## Project Description

The project is a Tic Tac Toe game, but it currently lacks responsiveness, making it challenging to play on different devices and screen sizes.

## Issues and Solutions

### Responsiveness Issue

#### Problem:
The game's layout is not responsive, causing it to display improperly on various screen sizes.

#### Solution:
To fix the responsiveness issue, follow these steps:

1. **Use CSS Flexbox/Grid**: Reorganize the layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure elements adjust according to the screen size.

2. **Media Queries**: Implement media queries in your CSS to specify different styles for different screen sizes (e.g., small screens, tablets, and desktops).

3. **Font Size and Spacing**: Adjust font sizes and spacing between elements to make the game elements fit well on small screens without overlapping.

4. **Responsive Images**: Ensure any images used are also responsive. Use the `max-width` property to prevent them from overflowing on small screens.

5. **Test on Multiple Devices**: After making changes, thoroughly test the game on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks good everywhere.

## How to Solve the Responsiveness Issue

1. **Flexbox and Grid**: Refactor the CSS for the `.container` and `.box` elements to use flexbox and grid to create a responsive game board.

   ```css
   .container {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
     grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);
   }
   .box {
     display: flex;
     align-items: center;
     justify-content: center;
   }
   ```

2. **Media Queries**: Add media queries to your CSS to set different styles for different screen sizes. For example:

   ```css
   @media (max-width: 768px) {
     /* Adjust styles for smaller screens */
   }
   ```

3. **Font Sizes**: Adjust the font size for better readability on smaller screens. For example:

   ```css
   .boxtext {
     font-size: 3rem;
   }
   ```

4. **Responsive Images**: Ensure your images (e.g., "start.gif") are responsive by setting a `max-width` property. For example:

   ```css
   .image {
     max-width: 100%;
     height: auto;
   }
   ```

5. **Testing**: Test your game on various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops, to verify that the responsiveness issues have been resolved.
